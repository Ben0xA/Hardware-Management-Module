v1.0 - 8/9/2012 - Steve Lee
    - Initial release
v1.0.1 - 8/10/2012 - Steve Lee
    - Updated logic on retrieving CIM_ComputerSystem to interop with Dell iDrac 
    where more than one CIM_ECP association to a Profile exists
    - Added RegisteredOrganization parameter to get-RegisteredProfile since some
    OEMs use the same Profile name although not implementing the DMTF Profile
    - Updated all occurrences of selecting RegisteredProfile to only use DMTF
v1.0.2 - 8/13/2012 - Steve Lee
    - Changed CimSession parameter to not be mandatory, now defaults to localmachine
    based on suggestion from Shay Levy.  Most functions won't work on a Windows box
    without additional WMI Providers installed, but some (like get-registeredprofile)
    will work.
    - Changed all exceptions/errors to warnings.  If one machine in an array of machines
    fails or doesn't support a Profile, no need to throw a terminating error
